            <h3>The Yakshagana is a night-long dance and drama performance practiced in Mangalore. The Hulivesha (Tiger
                dance) is a folk dance unique to this area, which is performed during Dasara and Krishna Janmashtami.
                Karadi Vesha (Bear Dance) is performed during Dasara in Mangalore. Bhuta Kola or spirit worship, is
                practised here. Kambala or buffalo race is conducted in water filled paddy fields. Korikatta
                (Cockfight) is another favourite sport for the people. To its supporters, cockfight, an ancient sport
                involving a fight between specially reared fowls held at the temples precincts in northern parts of
                Kasaragod, is not a blood sport but a feature of the rich cultural heritage of Tulunadu and an ancient
                ritual associated with the �daivasthanams� (temples) here. Nagaradhane or Snake worship is practised in
                the city according to the popular belief of the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on
                the top.

                Pad'danas (Oral Epics) which are ballad-like folk epics narrated in Tulu are sung by the community of
                impersonators together with the rhythmic beats. Some of the popular Beary songs are kolkai (sung during
                the play of kolata), unjal pat (sung while putting a child to cradle), moilanji pat and oppune pat
                (sung at weddings). The Eucharistic Procession is an annual Catholic religious procession led on the
                first Sunday of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar.

                    <h3>A kambala is an annual buffalo race held in the southwestern Indian state of Karnataka.
                        Traditionally, it is sponsored by local Tuluva landlords and households in the coastal
                        districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, a region collectively known as Tulu Nadu.

                        The kambla season generally starts in November and lasts until March. The kambalas are
                        organized through kambala samithis (Kambala Associations), of which there are currently 18.
                        Over 45 races are held annually in coastal Karnataka, including smaller remote villages such as
                        Vandaru and Gulvadi.Kadri Kambala used to be held at Kadri, Mangalore and it is called Devara
                        Kambala (God's kambala) as it is associated with Sri Manjunatha Temple in that city.[6] This
                        event was patronised by the Alupa kings of Mangalore, 300 years ago. For this reason, Kadri
                        kambala is also known as Arasu kambala (king's kambala).
